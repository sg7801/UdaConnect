Sample Requests:
Refer to the modules/location event producer -> service/client.py to get more info on making a sample request.
client.py sends the request to location event producer service through Protobuf message.
We have used gRPC for the structured data transportation like below location_event.proto:
message LocationEventMessage {
  int32 userId = 1;
  int32 latitude = 2;
  int32 longitude = 3;
}
service ItemService {
  rpc Create(LocationEventMessage) returns (LocationEventMessage);
}
